# Slot Machine Python Game
A simple Python-based slot machine game that allows users to deposit money, place bets on multiple lines, and spin the reels. The game checks for winning combinations based on predefined symbol values and rewards the player accordingly. It's a fun way to practice basic Python concepts like loops, functions, and handling user input.
